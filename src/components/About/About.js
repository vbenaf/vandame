              The primary area of my interest is front-end. My passion for code
              has begun when Adobe Flash was a complete innovation, alongside
              with CSS 1.0 and HTML 4.01 as standards of the current web.

              For over a decade I had many opportunities to work in a vast
              spectrum of web technologies what let me gather a significant
              amount of various experience. Working for companies and
              individuals around the globe I met and learnt from amazing and
              ambitious people.

            <p>
              I currently work remotely with a selected freelance client base
              and are open for new opportunities.
